# Pycaret

PyCaret is an open source simple to use python library for doing machine learning. It is quite easy yet powerful in the sense that you donâ€™t need to know all the ML algorithms and the nitty gritty before creating a production ready model for your business.
PyCaret makes it easier for you. It acts as a wrapper around the most popular Machine Learning Libraries such as Scikit-learn,Xgboost, LightGB,etc. It also offers a simple API of functions that you can use to build and evaluate several models without much stress.

## Installation

To install PyCaret you can use pip as below

pip install pycaret

With PyCaret you can easily do

1. Compare Models
2. Create Models
3. Tune Models
4. Evaluate Models
5. Interpret Models
6. Make predictions with the Model
7. Save and Load Models(Model Serialization)
8. Deploy Models

So to compare different models you just call compare_models() function
